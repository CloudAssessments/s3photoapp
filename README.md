Picture Upload
===================

PO: Anthony James

A multi-project repo of services that work together to form a demo to enable users to get and upload photos to Amazon S3.

## Development Installation
1. Clone the repository into your local machine
1. Move into each project in `/s3-photos/apps/` and run `npm install`
    - _Note: There is currently only one project (`photo-storage`) available right now_
